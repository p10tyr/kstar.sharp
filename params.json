Runnable on IIS or XSP or anything you configure to run ASP.NET MVC\r\n \r\n##Todo:##\r\n \r\n - Windows UWP App (Native)\r\n - iOS App (Xamarin - But I dont have a mac so possibly Cordova but i think its too limited?)\r\n - Android App (Xamarin)\r\n \r\n##Disclaimer##\r\n\r\nThe protocol has been reverse engineered and the goal of this code is for read only use only. \r\nI cannot guarantee it will work with all models and I cannot guarantee stability\r\nFor your safety this repository will never implement setting/writting anything back to the inverter.\r\nPlease use the official kstar app for any maintanence required on your inverter.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Tested Platforms##\r\n\r\n###Windows###\r\nObviosly all this works great on Windows.\r\n\r\n###*nix###\r\n\r\nTo push the boundries I have the following lab setup for *nix\r\n - FreeNAS 10 with ZFS\r\n - FreeBSD 10 jail\r\n - Latest mono installed in the jail\r\n - Console app runs within a screen. Unfortunately UDP broadcast do not work in jails at the moment. You have to specifiy and ipadress using console.exe --ip-192.168.x.y\r\n - XSP running in another screen and set to the root of MVC4\r\n - nginx proxying port 80 to XSP\r\n\r\nCurrently this FreeNAS implemention has been running for days, logging data to sqlite file every 30 seconds. MVC reads from the same sqlite file and the basic dashboard works well. Thanks to the advantages of ZFS on FreeNAS it actually runs faster on my low end \"nas\" box than my beefy dev machine. +1 for ZFS!\r\n\r\nXSP Command line\r\n\r\nSet nginx_enable to YES in /etc/rc.conf  or use 'onestart'\r\n\r\nfastcgi-mono-server4 /applications=/:/mnt/storage/mvc4/ /socket=tcp:127.0.0.1:9000\r\n\r\n\r\n###Android###\r\nWill reuse the C# library in Xamarin Android project\r\n\r\n###iOS###\r\nWill reuse the C# library in Xamarin iOS project but there seems to be initial problems with this. Firstly I don't have a mac and secondly Xamarin decided to not install the iOS SDK... Looking bleak as usual with iOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Tested Inverters##\r\n\r\nHybrid KSE4000 with WiFi, EZMeter and 10kW Battery array - Stable\r\n\r\nNeed help adding other kstar inverters.\r\nI hope I can add other manufacturers too maybe - we'll see what happens\r\n\r\n##Screens##\r\n\r\n###Console###\r\n\r\n![kstar.sharp.console](http://i.imgur.com/k97oYF6.png \"kstar.sharp.console in Jail\")\r\n\r\n###MVC4 Dashboard###\r\n\r\n![kstar.sharp.mvc4](http://i.imgur.com/s0fUrq1.png \"kstar.sharp.mvc4 in Jail\")\r\n\r\nAll data over some time\r\n\r\n\r\n![kstar.sharp.mvc4](http://i.imgur.com/HOYTo1D.png \"kstar.sharp.mvc4 in Jail\")\r\n\r\nCross section of that data\r\n\r\n![kstar.sharp.mvc4](http://i.imgur.com/uGHr8yF.png \"kstar.sharp.mvc4 in Jail\")\r\n\r\n\r\n# License\r\n - This source code has been made available for educational uses only but is NOT licensed as any version of \"Educational Community License\"\r\n - Reverse engineering of some protocols were accomplished by monitoring unencrypted data within a sandboxed, private network.
